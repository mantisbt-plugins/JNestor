JNestor: another majordomo in java
----------------------------------

This is a project in development, so documentation is still sparse. 

The good news are that I am plenty of time to attend to the 
mailing list, so I don't mind to answer to whatever question 
you may ask. Feel free to ask them to jnestor-general@lists.sourceforge.net.


Version 1.0
-----------

Release: 2011-02-04

    - Development of the core of the project
    - Development of the mantis mail processor (MailProcessorMantis) 
      and various actions: Archive -to archive messages-, 
      Deleter -to delete messages-, Resend -to resend some 
      messages to other accounts or forward the messages-

Future directions: 

    - Improve the mantis actions to detect if they are from a 
      new issue or a follow-up of an existing one (a new note):
      this could make the actions be more precise in their doings
