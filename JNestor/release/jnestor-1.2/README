JNestor: another majordomo in java
----------------------------------

This is a project in development, so documentation is still sparse. 

The good news are that I am plenty of time to attend to the 
mailing list, so I don't mind to answer to whatever question 
you may ask. Feel free to ask them to jnestor-general@lists.sourceforge.net.


Version 1.2
-----------

Release: 2012-02-20

    - I detected a problem with the resend part of the custom 
    actions of mantis: it doesn't resend the file properly. 
    I've fixed allowing to resend in text/html format instead 
    of using pure text sending. 
    - Moreover, there were some problems with the configuration: 
    the texts were badly composed, and the final result in mantis 
    wasn't good: I think it was caused by the fact that those texts
    were copied from a properties file to a mantis file and they 
    weren't working well
    
    
Version 1.1
-----------

Release: 2012-02-07

    - I've suppressed the file jnestor-config.properties and
      integrate it into the config file of spring (applicationContext.xml)
      Now the configuration its done changing parts of this file.



Version 1.0
-----------

Release: 2012-02-04

    - Development of the core of the project
    - Development of the mantis mail processor (MailProcessorMantis) 
      and various actions: Archive -to archive messages-, 
      Deleter -to delete messages-, Resend -to resend some 
      messages to other accounts or forward the messages-

Future directions: 

    - Improve the mantis actions to detect if they are from a 
      new issue or a follow-up of an existing one (a new note):
      this could make the actions be more precise in their doings
