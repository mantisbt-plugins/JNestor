JNestor
=======

JNestor can convert emails into mantis issues. 

Think of JNestor as a majordomo who takes duty of read the email, 
consider if it match certain rules and then adds it as a Mantis
issue. In the process, JNestor can feed some custom fields of mantis
if you need it. 

Back to the inbox, JNestor can move the original email into other 
file folder (yes it needs an IMAP connection to do so) and copy the 
original email with the issue number in the subject: so, you only 
have to answer this email to give back the answer to the user: 
more easier than that, impossible. 

I am using it in a production environment with Windows, so I can 
proudly say that this software is making his work since the 
release of the first version.
